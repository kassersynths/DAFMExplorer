    "\n",
    "In the late 1960s, **John Chowning**, a composer and researcher at Stanford University's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA), made a revolutionary discovery. While experimenting with digital audio synthesis, he found that **frequency modulation**—using one oscillator to modulate the frequency of another—could create incredibly rich, complex timbres.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Breakthrough:**\n",
    "- **1967**: Chowning discovers that FM can create musical timbres\n",
    "- **1971**: First musical composition using FM synthesis\n",
    "- **1973**: Stanford patents the FM synthesis algorithm\n",
    "- **1975**: Yamaha licenses the patent from Stanford\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Mattered:**\n",
    "Before FM synthesis, creating complex sounds required multiple oscillators and filters—expensive and computationally intensive. FM synthesis could create the same rich timbres using just **two oscillators** (called \"operators\" in FM terminology). This was revolutionary because:\n",
    "- **Computational efficiency**: Less processing power needed\n",

    "\n",
    "Algorithm (CON) results point to a clear “default choice” in real-world YM2612 game programming: **Algorithm 4** dominates the dataset. This topology effectively gives you **two carrier branches that are summed at the output**, each shaped by its own modulator, so you can think of it as **two FM voices being mixed inside one channel** (two modulated carriers added by amplitude). In practice, that’s an incredibly composer-friendly structure: you get a wide palette (bright + body, attack + sustain, tone + edge) while staying predictable and easy to balance in a busy mix. The other algorithms that show up strongly also make sense musically: **Algorithm 2** is a more complex, “interesting” chain where modulation becomes layered and intertwined, producing richer and sometimes more unstable spectra; **Algorithm 5** is a classic “one modulator feeds multiple carriers” setup (Op1 modulating Ops 2/3/4 that then sum), great for bright, harmonically dense sounds that still keep multiple audible components; and **Algorithm 0** is the fully serial chain (1→2→3→4), which excels at extreme complexity, metallic edge, and sound-design timbres—useful, but harder to control than the more balanced topologies 🎹.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feedback (FL) distribution is even more telling: there are basically **no half-measures**. Presets overwhelmingly choose either **FL = 7** (maximum) or **FL = 0** (none), reflecting how feedback behaves on the YM2612: it’s not just a subtle “character” knob, it’s a switch between two worlds ⚡. With **maximum feedback**, Operator 1 stops behaving like a clean sine source and becomes a **harmonic/noise generator**, injecting aggression, metallic brightness, grit, and “cut”—exactly what you need for leads, basses, and percussive attacks that must survive on small speakers and in dense arrangements. With **no feedback**, you keep a **stable, controllable sine-like operator**, ideal as a clean carrier or a precise modulator when you want predictable harmonic placement and smooth envelopes; the dataset suggests composers treated feedback as a deliberate stylistic commitment rather than a parameter to gently “fine tune” 🎧.\n"

    "## 🌈 Brightness & Complexity: Interpreting Higher-Level FM Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Brightness Index** distribution reveals a strong and very deliberate clustering around **mid-to-high values (≈ 0.55–0.7)**. This tells us that YM2612 presets used in games were rarely dark or dull by default; instead, composers consistently pushed sounds toward clarity and shine ✨. Since this index combines **TL (output level), AR (attack rate), and MUL (frequency multiplier)**, a higher brightness reflects faster attacks, stronger harmonic emphasis, and more energetic spectra. Historically, this makes perfect sense: on consumer TVs and small speakers, darker FM tones tend to disappear, while brighter sounds cut through the mix. What’s interesting is that the distribution is not maxed out at 1.0—composers were not chasing pure harshness, but rather a **controlled brightness sweet spot** that balanced presence with musicality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Complexity Score** distribution paints a complementary picture 🧠. Values are heavily concentrated in the **upper-mid range (≈ 0.6–0.85)**, indicating that most presets relied on **multiple active operators and moderately complex algorithms**, rather than minimal or extreme configurations. This suggests a strong preference for **rich internal motion**—enough operator interaction to create evolving timbres, but not so much that the sound becomes unstable or noisy. Very low-complexity sounds (simple, almost subtractive-like FM patches) are rare, reinforcing the idea that YM2612 was primarily used as a **characterful synthesis engine**, not just a sine generator. At the same time, the avoidance of the absolute maximum complexity hints at a practical mindset: composers wanted depth and texture, but still needed predictable behavior, fast programming, and reliable playback during gameplay 🎮.\n"

    "## 🎛️ Algorithm (CON) Distribution by Top Games\n",
    "\n",
    "The first chart shows that, while there’s a shared “YM2612 grammar,” each game ends up with a very recognizable **algorithm fingerprint**. Across almost all titles, **Algorithm 4** repeatedly rises to the top, reinforcing it as the most dependable and musically flexible routing—effectively letting composers layer *two FM voices inside one channel* and balance body with edge. At the same time, the differences between games are striking: **Pulseman** is an extreme case with one algorithm dominating most of its presets, which fits its aggressive, electronic/techno-leaning sound design ⚡. By contrast, titles like **Gunstar Heroes**, **Streets of Rage 3**, and **Thunder Force IV** spread their usage across several algorithms, suggesting broader instrument variety and more deliberate “routing choices” per patch rather than a single default. In other words: some scores build a signature sound by committing to one topology, while others get their identity from constantly switching FM structures 🎹.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌈 Average Brightness Index by Top Games\n",
    "\n",
    "The second chart highlights a strong convergence: these games cluster tightly in a **mid-to-high Brightness Index range**, with no one living in the “dark” zone. That’s a very practical outcome of Genesis-era realities—patches needed enough bite to stay audible through small TV speakers and dense mixes, but not so much brightness that the soundtrack becomes fatiguing. **The Adventures of Batman and Robin** and **Pulseman** sit at the bright end, matching their reputation for sharp, punchy, high-energy timbres ✨, while **Ristar** and **Sonic 3 & Knuckles** sit a bit lower, consistent with a slightly rounder, more melodic palette that still preserves clarity. Overall, it suggests composers converged on a **safe brightness sweet spot**: bright enough to cut, controlled enough to stay musical 🎮.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌑 Top 10 Least Bright Games — A Different FM Aesthetic\n",
    "\n",
    "This chart highlights a small but very telling group of games that deliberately sit at the **low end of the Brightness Index**, clearly breaking away from the Genesis norm of bright, cutting FM sounds. Titles like *Thunder Pro Wrestling Retsuden*, *The Tick*, *Tinhead*, or *Top Gear 2* favor noticeably darker patches, suggesting a sound design approach where **warmth, weight, and atmosphere** take priority over immediacy and bite. In many of these cases—especially racing games and sports titles—the music benefits from a **less aggressive spectral profile**, allowing groove, rhythm, and low–mid energy to dominate without competing harshly with sound effects. From a technical perspective, this likely translates to lower operator output levels, slower attacks, and fewer high multipliers, resulting in smoother, more subdued FM tones. Historically, these games often relied more heavily on PCM drums or strong bass lines, reducing the need for extremely bright FM voices. The existence of this cluster confirms that while high brightness was the Genesis “default,” experienced composers selectively rejected it when the game’s mood, genre, or pacing demanded a darker, more restrained sonic identity 🎮."

    "\n",
    "**Why Composers Matter:**\n",
    "Each composer brought their unique style, technical approach, and creative vision to the YM2612. By analyzing their presets, we can discover their \"sonic signatures\"—the parameter choices that made their music instantly recognizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Yuzo Koshiro: The Electronic Music Pioneer**\n",
    "Born in 1967, Yuzo Koshiro is perhaps the most famous video game composer of the 16-bit era. His work on **Streets of Rage** (Bare Knuckle in Japan) revolutionized video game music by blending FM synthesis with electronic dance music. Koshiro was inspired by early house and techno—he would listen to tracks from Chicago and Detroit, then recreate those sounds using the YM2612's limited resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fun Fact**: Koshiro programmed the Streets of Rage soundtrack using assembly language directly on the Genesis hardware, giving him unprecedented control over the chip. This is why Streets of Rage sounds so different from other Genesis games—Koshiro was pushing the hardware in ways that higher-level tools couldn't achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Masato Nakamura: From J-Pop to Video Games**\n",
    "Masato Nakamura is a member of the Japanese pop duo **Dreams Come True**, one of Japan's most successful bands. When Sega approached him to compose for **Sonic the Hedgehog**, he brought a pop sensibility that was unusual for video games at the time. The main theme, \"Green Hill Zone,\" became one of the most recognizable melodies in gaming history.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge**: Nakamura had to adapt his pop songwriting style to the YM2612's limitations. The result? Melodies that were catchy, memorable, and perfectly suited for gameplay—music that players would hear hundreds of times without getting tired of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hiroshi Kawaguchi: The Sega Veteran**\n",
    "Hiroshi Kawaguchi worked at Sega for decades, composing for games like **Golden Axe**, **OutRun**, and **After Burner**. His style emphasized strong melodies and clear arrangements—perfect for arcade games where players needed to hear important audio cues over the noise of an arcade.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Mastery**: Kawaguchi's presets often show careful attention to operator balance and envelope shaping. He understood that in a busy arcade environment, sounds needed to cut through clearly—this is reflected in his parameter choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Norio Hanzawa: The Treasure Sound Designer**\n",
    "Norio Hanzawa worked at Treasure, a studio known for pushing hardware to its limits. His work on **Gunstar Heroes** showcases complex, layered FM sounds that create rich textures despite the chip's limitations. Hanzawa's approach was more experimental—he wasn't afraid to use unusual algorithm combinations or push feedback to create unique timbres.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Analysis Matters:**\n",
    "By comparing presets from different composers, we can see how:\n",
    "- **Technical constraints** shaped creative choices\n",
    "- **Personal style** emerged despite working with the same hardware\n",
    "- **Regional differences** (Japanese vs. American composers) influenced sound design\n",
    "- **Game genres** required different sonic approaches"

    "## 🎛️ Mode Algorithm (CON) — Top 10 Composers\n",
    "\n",
    "This chart shows a striking convergence among the most prolific YM2612 composers: **Algorithm 4** clearly dominates as the modal choice for almost everyone. This reinforces its role as the practical “sweet spot” of Genesis FM synthesis—an algorithm that effectively behaves like two FM voices summed together, offering both richness and control. Composers such as **Yuzo Koshiro**, **Masato Nakamura**, and **Nobuo Uematsu** all gravitate toward this topology, despite their very different musical styles, which suggests that Algorithm 4 was less a stylistic choice and more a *structural workhorse*. The main exception is **Naoki Kodaka**, whose lower modal value hints at a more idiosyncratic routing strategy, consistent with his darker, more experimental sound worlds. Overall, the chart illustrates that even highly individual composers converged on the same FM topology when working under the constraints of the YM2612 🎹.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔁 Mode Feedback (FL) — Top 10 Composers\n",
    "\n",
    "The feedback chart is almost shockingly uniform: **FL = 7** is the modal value for virtually every composer shown. This confirms that maximum feedback was not a special effect, but a **default compositional tool** on the Genesis. High feedback turns Operator 1 into a dense harmonic or noise-rich source, adding aggression, brightness, and presence with minimal programming overhead. For composers like **Koshiro** or **Yamashita**, whose music needed to cut through fast-paced action and heavy percussion, this choice makes perfect sense. The lack of variation here underscores a key insight: feedback on the YM2612 behaves more like a *binary aesthetic switch* than a subtle continuous control—either fully embraced for impact, or avoided entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌈 Brightness Index (Mean ± Std) — Top 10 Composers\n",
    "\n",
    "Brightness Index values cluster tightly in the **mid-to-high range (≈ 0.55–0.7)** across all top composers, revealing a shared perceptual target rather than wildly different tonal philosophies. Even composers with very different musical identities—such as **Masato Nakamura’s melodic pop sensibility** versus **Koshiro’s club-inspired aggression**—arrive at similar brightness averages. This reflects the realities of Genesis playback: small TV speakers, limited dynamic range, and dense mixes strongly favor brighter FM patches. The relatively modest standard deviations suggest that brightness was not wildly exploratory, but carefully managed, reinforcing the idea of a widely understood “safe brightness zone” that maximized clarity without tipping into harshness ✨.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 Complexity Score (Mean ± Std) — Top 10 Composers\n",
    "\n",
    "The Complexity Score chart shows more variation than brightness, but still a clear tendency toward **upper-mid complexity values**. Most composers cluster around **0.65–0.8**, indicating a preference for patches with multiple active operators and meaningful internal modulation, yet stopping short of maximal complexity. This balance reflects a deep practical understanding of FM synthesis: richer operator interactions create expressive, evolving timbres, but excessive complexity can reduce predictability and mix clarity. Slight differences between composers are revealing—some, like **Nobuo Uematsu**, lean a bit higher toward lush internal structure, while others favor slightly simpler designs—yet everyone remains within a narrow, musically effective band. The takeaway is clear: Genesis composers consistently sought **controlled richness**, not chaos, in their FM designs 🎮.\n"

    "The statistical table reinforces this visual impression of convergence. Across all major regions, the **modal algorithm is Algorithm 4**, and the **modal feedback is FL = 7**, confirming that these were not stylistic outliers but universal defaults. Brightness averages are nearly identical for Japan, USA, and Unknown (≈ 0.62), with the UK slightly higher (0.66), while complexity scores remain tightly clustered around ~0.70. The main difference between regions is not *how* sounds were designed, but *how many* presets are represented—Japan overwhelmingly dominates the dataset in sheer volume. Overall, this suggests that YM2612 sound design evolved into a **shared international language**, where optimal FM strategies emerged naturally and were reused everywhere, independent of geography 🎛️✨.\n",

    "## 🌍 Embedding Space by Nationality\n",
    "\n",
    "The embedding visualization shows a **strong overlap between nationalities**, with Japanese, USA, UK, and Unknown presets largely occupying the same dense regions of the latent space. Rather than forming clearly separated clusters, presets from different regions are deeply interwoven, suggesting that **timbre design on the YM2612 converged globally toward similar solutions**, regardless of cultural background. This makes sense in historical context: composers across regions were working with the same hardware constraints, similar reference sounds, and often shared genre goals (action, platformers, racing). The lack of strong geographic separation implies that *technology and medium* had a stronger shaping force on sound design than nationality itself 🌐🎮.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🇬🇧 A Distinct UK Sonic Signature?\n",
    "\n",
    "On closer inspection of the embedding, the **UK presets do show a subtle but meaningful deviation**, tending to cluster toward the **lower-left region** of the latent space rather than fully overlapping with the main mass dominated by Japanese presets. While the separation is not absolute, this displacement suggests that UK composers may indeed have explored a **slightly different sonic universe** on the YM2612. Historically, this aligns well with context: many UK developers came from a home-computer background (ZX Spectrum, Amiga, Atari ST), where darker, rougher, and more noise-oriented timbres were common. When transitioning to the Mega Drive, these aesthetics likely carried over, resulting in patches that are perceptually distinct despite using the same algorithms and feedback settings. In other words, the UK did not reject the “standard” FM toolbox—but they **bent it toward a grittier, moodier space**, carving out a recognizable sonic fingerprint within the shared Genesis sound world 🎮🌑."

    "Although **GEMS-powered games represent only a small fraction of the dataset**—just **7.3% of all presets** and **43 out of 547 games**—they still contribute a substantial body of material, with over **1,600 presets** available for analysis. Titles such as *Nightmare Circus*, *Marsupilami*, *Shadowrun*, and *Chakan* stand out with unusually large preset counts, reflecting the fact that GEMS encouraged more systematic and reusable sound design compared to many hand-crafted FM workflows. Interestingly, the **average number of presets per game is slightly lower for GEMS titles** than for non-GEMS games, suggesting that GEMS prioritized *structured consistency* over sheer preset volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a synthesis perspective, the contrast is revealing. **GEMS games overwhelmingly favor Algorithm 2 as their modal choice**, while the broader Genesis ecosystem converges on **Algorithm 4**, reinforcing the idea that GEMS imposed (or at least encouraged) a different internal FM architecture. Even more striking is the feedback behavior: **GEMS presets default to FL = 0**, whereas non-GEMS presets almost universally push feedback to the maximum (FL = 7). This aligns perfectly with GEMS’ historical role as a higher-level music engine—designed for stability, predictability, and portability—rather than raw, aggressive timbral experimentation. Brightness and complexity averages are only slightly lower in GEMS presets, indicating that **the sonic difference is not about dullness or simplicity**, but about *control*: GEMS trades extreme feedback-driven character for cleaner, more manageable FM tones that could be reliably deployed across large, multi-track game soundtracks 🎛️✨.\n"

    "\n",
    "This embedding makes visually explicit what the statistics already suggested: **GEMS and non-GEMS presets largely inhabit the same sonic territory**, with no hard separation between the two groups. The GEMS presets (highlighted) are deeply interwoven with the broader cloud of non-GEMS sounds, indicating that GEMS was not producing an alien or radically different timbral palette. Instead, it operated firmly *within* the established YM2612 sound space. That said, GEMS points appear slightly more concentrated toward the central mass, while non-GEMS presets spread a bit further toward the periphery, hinting at greater experimentation and extremity outside the GEMS workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern aligns perfectly with GEMS’ historical role as a **production-oriented abstraction layer** rather than a creative constraint. By favoring stable algorithms, low feedback, and predictable behavior, GEMS effectively *compressed the expressive space*, reducing outliers while still covering the core timbres needed for game music. Non-GEMS composers, working closer to the metal, were more willing to push the chip into edge cases—high feedback noise, unstable modulations, or extreme routings—which manifest here as broader dispersion. In short, the image shows that **GEMS standardized FM sound design without sterilizing it**, anchoring itself at the center of the Genesis sonic universe rather than orbiting outside it 🎮✨.\n"
